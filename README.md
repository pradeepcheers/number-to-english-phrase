# number-to-english-phrase

The task is to write a CLI that given any number between 0 and 1,000 inclusive, returns the grammatically-correct English phrase for this number (e.g. given 111 it shows "one hundred and eleven", given 21 it shows "twenty-one").

## Usage
	
(parse-number 21) ;;=> should return "twenty-one"
